	<h1 class="post-title">Picking a Method</h1>
	<span class="post-date">Sun 15 February 2015</span>
	<p>Over the course of my research, I've collected thousands of time-series on the movement and behavior of worms under different conditions. To frame my research in a general sense: I want to know why some experimental conditions change the behavior of the worms and what those behavioral changes are. My research sits in a very specific niche, filled with details about worm biology, tracking objects under noisy conditions, and behavioral analysis. Despite this mess of details, I also have to solve a problem familiar to any data-scientist: the problem of Picking a Method.</p>
<p>This problem has a thousand faces. Which clustering method should I use? What features are important in this time series? If you have data and you don't have a clear story, chances are that you are in some phase of Picking (and implementing) a Method. What makes this problem so hard is that every type of data has its own peculiarities that might invalidate the assumptions of a your favorite method. You are left trying to find an optimum in some cost function involving how effective a method is for your data (reproducible and accurate), how easy it is to implement, how quickly it runs, and how understandable the process is.</p>
<p>Ideally, you want to pick a method that is powerful but quick to implement. However, there's no one best strategy for figuring this out. Some of the ways I've tried to Pick a Method have been asking an expert, finding papers that analyze similar data, reading a textbook chapter, Googling all combinations of keywords with which I could describe my data, searching for winning entries in related data analysis contests, and trying every related module in the Python Package Index... The list could continue.</p>
<p>Although the current state of Picking a Method resembles a messy dark art, I don't think that this state will continue.</p>
<p>I recently read a paper that compared tens of thousands of equally-spaced univariate time-series and several thousand techniques for analyzing them. The paper proposed several potential uses for this type of data, however, one feature in particular caught my eye. By sweeping a dataset with a comprehensive set of analysis methods, the results could be used to suggest a few key methods that might be worth pursuing. Although this type of analysis is not new, (researchers have long been using gold-standard test-sets by which to compare methods) its scale gives it a different quality.</p>
<p>It seems like a new type of search is on the verge of becoming widely available. We are hitting a critical-mass in three factors: (1) the number of freely available online datasets (2) the amount of open-source methods that can be downloaded and easily implemented (3) and the speed of processing a large number of methods. Even so, it will be a lot of work for anyone to set up a user-friendly platform for evaluating which computational methods are usable for a given data set.</p>
<p>Give it five to ten years, but Picking a Method will be trivial.</p>
